 * Highlights:
 * 
 * 1) This is a really open question/project so the imeplementation
 *    is just in terms of my understanding, further details and discussion
 *    will be much helpful.
 *    
 * 2) For speed, I use multiple threads to maximize hardware usage. The
 *    thread_pool and event_t are quiet generic and can handle any types of
 *    calculation interface. Also, the thread_pool is sharable, meaning 
 *    multiple different types of calculation can run at the same time.
 *    
 * 3) For generic, besides of thread_pool and event_t, the input_t and
 *    DoCalc are made generialize. Also helper functions are made to faciliate
 *    the usage, such like make_event, callback, etc.
 *    
 * 4) Another point needs to be considered: program speed may be impacted by
 *    various reason. Using multiple thread won't guaranttee speed improvement
 *    if calculation itself is fast enough, but it'll be much useful if calc
 *    is very heavy.

/* Our trading system contains a number of calculation engines that perform calcs on a request basis.
 * The goal of this assignment is to come up with a generic framework for accelerating the calculations
 * in these engines. We have given you a benchmark test that provides a workload that is representative
 * of the types of calculations we are trying to accelerate.
 *
 * The goal of this assignment is to get the provided test to run as quickly as possible.
 *
 * Your solution should be generic. It should be easily extendible to methods other than IsPrime. It should
 * also be extendible to calculations with various function signatures. You should not modify IsPrime or Math.h.
