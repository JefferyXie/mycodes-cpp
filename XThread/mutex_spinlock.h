// mutex vs. spinlock:
// Spinlock keeps checking the lock (busy waiting), while mutex puts
// threads waiting for the lock into sleep (blocked). A busy-waiting
// thread wastes CPU cycles, while a blocked thread does not. Regardless
// of this difference, mutex and spinlock have very similar behavior.

// implementation of spinlock
volatile int lock = 0;

  while (__sync_lock_test_and_set(&lock, 1)) while (lock);
  // critical section
  __sync_lock_release(&lock);
}

// critical section vs. mutex:
// 1), cs is done in user mode without involving the kernel
// 2), cs is not a kernel object so it works only within single process
// 3), cs is faster as it doesn't require the system call into kernel mode
// 4), mutex is more CPU intensive and slower due to a larger amount of bookkeeping
//     and the deep execution path into the kernel taken to acquire a mutex
// 5), cs remains in thread context, and consists of merely checking and
//     incrementing/decrementing lock-count related data.

mutex: can multi-process in linux share same mutex?

// memory ordering
// https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686355.aspx
// Processors can support instructions for memory barriers with acquire, release,
// and fence semantics. These semantics describe the order in which results of an
// operation become available. With acquire semantics, the results of the operation
// are available before the results of any operation that appears after it in code.
// With release semantics, the results of the operation are available after the results
// of any operation that appears before it in code. Fence semantics combine acquire and
// release semantics. The results of an operation with fence semantics are available before
// those of any operation that appears after it in code and after those of any operation
// that appears before it.

// semaphore vs. mutex
// A mutex is essentially the same thing as a binary semaphore and sometimes uses the
// same basic implementation. The differences between them are in how they are used.
// While a binary semaphore may be used as a mutex, a mutex is a more specific use-case,
// which allows extra guarantees:
// 1), Mutexes have a concept of an owner. Only the process that locked the mutex is supposed
//     to unlock it. If the owner is stored by the mutex this can be verified at runtime.
// 2), Mutexes may provide priority inversion safety. If the mutex knows its current owner,
//     it is possible to promote the priority of the owner whenever a higher-priority task
//     starts waiting on the mutex.
// 3), Mutexes may also provide deletion safety, where the process holding the mutex cannot
//     be accidentally deleted.

// c++ mutexes:
// 1), mutex
// 2), recrusive_mutex
// 3), timed_mutex
// 4), recursive_timed_mutex
